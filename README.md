# E-Commerce-Customer-Churn-Analysis-and-Prediction

Customer Churn is when customers stop purchasing/using business's products or service in certain period of time. Customer churn is one critical metric because it's less expensive to retain existing customers than acquire new customers. I analysed E-commerce customer churn rate and looked for user patterns whose likely churned. Customer churn rate indicates how many existing customers are not using products-services or switch to business competitors.



The business objective to be achieved is to get a prediction system that can be used to find out which customers will churn and the factors that occur.



The output to be generated is a prediction of the churn status of a customer. If you can predict which customer will churn, you can help the marketing team to develop marketing strategies in an effort to avoid losses in the form of losing customers.

For customers who have just bought electronic goods, cross-selling can be done by offering electronic accessories.
