# E-Commerce-Customer-Churn-Analysis-and-Prediction

- Customer Churn is when customers stop purchasing/using business's products or service in certain period of time. Customer churn is one critical metric because it's less expensive to retain existing customers than acquire new customers.  I analyzed  E-commerce customer churn rate and looked for user patterns whos likely churned. Customer churn rate indicates how many existing customers are not using products-services or switch to business competitors.

- The business objective to be achieved is to get a prediction system that can be used to find out which customers will churn and the factors that occur.

- The output to be generated is a prediction of the churn status of a customer. If you can predict which customer will churn, you can help the marketing team to develop marketing strategies in an effort to avoid losses in the form of losing customers.
